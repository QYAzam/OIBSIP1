🚀 How to Run
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

Clone or Download the Repository:
If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

(Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL if this project were in a Git repo. For now, you will manually create the files.)

Otherwise, simply create the following three files in a new folder on your computer:

index.html

style.css

script.js

Place the Code:

Copy the HTML code into index.html.

Copy the CSS code into style.css.

Copy the JavaScript code into script.js.

Open in Browser:
Navigate to the folder where you saved the files and open index.html with your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

👨‍💻 Usage
Enter Temperature: Type the numerical temperature value into the "Enter Temperature" input field.

Select "From Unit": Choose the current unit of your temperature from the "From Unit" dropdown (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).

Select "To Unit": Choose the unit you want to convert the temperature to from the "To Unit" dropdown.

Convert: Click the "Convert" button, or press Enter in the input field.

View Result: The converted temperature will be displayed in the "Result" area.

💡 How it Works (Briefly)
The JavaScript code captures the input value and selected units. It first standardizes the input temperature to Celsius, then converts this Celsius value to the desired output unit (Fahrenheit or Kelvin). Finally, it displays the formatted result. Validation is included to ensure only numerical inputs are processed.
